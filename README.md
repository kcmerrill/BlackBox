Vitamin C Test Runner
========

A multi language test runner that supports php, python out of the box. Javascript will be coming soon. Because Vitamin C runs commands via the command line, adding your language of choice should be rather simple by simply adding another test runner.

The results are a bar that is at the bottom of the page. 

- **Green Bar**
 - Indicates that all tests are passing
- **Yellow Bar**
 - Indicates that tests are running, and none have yet to return with a valid result
- **Red Bar**
 - Indicates that one or more tests have failed. The text displayed in the bar should indicate what test failed and why.


##How does it work?
A quick youtube video providing a demo on it's use.

###Side Note
It's an early version prototype that will have quite a few bugs. If you see any please feel free to do a PR and I'd be happy to merge them in.
